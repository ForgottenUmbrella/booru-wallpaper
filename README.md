#Booru Wallpaper
A work-in-progress console application that aims to basically be the 
Mbooru extension for Muzei on Android, on PC.

This program will set the desktop wallpaper (in Windows, Mac and Linux) 
to a random image from a booru that fits the specified criteria (mainly
tags). After a specified amount of time has passed, another image will
be fetched.

I like Muzei, and a Muzei Client exists, but it doesn't support 
Danbooru, and so this project came to be. I don't intend to replace the
Muzei Client (by madhacker at http://forum.xda-developers.com/android/general/windows-muzeiclient-change-windows-t2957586), just have something
that works for me. Maybe someday I'll make a fork of the client, with 
support for extensions. I don't know. What else am I supposed to put in 
this readme file?
